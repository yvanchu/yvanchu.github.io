    <h1>Welcome to Yvan Chu's minimalist website!</h1>
    <p>It's a work in progress, but I'm trying to keep it simple.</p>

    <h2>Who?</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I am Yvan Chu. I like to play with new technology, make things, and
      work with people. I am currently studying Computer Science @Northwestern,
      and my goal is to build technology that'll improve the way people live,
      work, and play.
    </p>
    <a href="portfolio">Some of my past work here.</a>

    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <h3>Work</h3>
    <p>
      Maximizing deep and fulfilling work. Technology will automate the mundane
      and empower people to reach and stay in flow.
      <br />
      That is why I joined Microsoft. I know work can be incredibly meaningful
      and fulfilling, but it often is not. I will build technology to help
      eliminate boring, stressful, and confusing work.
    </p>
    <h3>Life</h3>
    <p>
      I am actually not sure how living in the future will be or what coherent
      theme it will entail. I am most hopeful in tech that will help save time
      and increase safety. For example, self-driving cars.
    </p>
    <h3>Play</h3>
    <p>
      The current digital ecosystem is polluted with junk content. Like junk
      food, junk content are entertaining but not fulfilling. It is addicting
      and mostly driven by engagement and profit. I want to develop experiences
      that are playful, interactive, and fun. These experiences will help people
      strengthen existing and develop new relationships.
      <br />
      That is the reason I created BearRoom, but I still have ways to go in
      order to accomplish my vision in any of these three areas.
    </p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I have spent around half of my life in Taiwan, and the other half in Guam.
      I am currently a Computer Science student at Northwestern as a QuestBridge
      Scholar. I am passionate about innovation, startups, and maker culture. My
      speciality is in learning new skills and programming languages, problem
      solving, and adapting to different team dynamics.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am always looking forward to meeting and collaborating with new people.

      There are also other ways to keep in touch with me:

    </ul>

    <h2>Why only html?</h2>
    <p>
      It is simple, fast, and dare I say, beautiful. It loosely represents my
      approach towards design and engineering as well as my developing visual
      design sense.
      <br />
      Credit where credit is due, this website is inspired by
      <a href="//eladgil.com">eladgil.com</a> and
      <a href="//motherfuckingwebsite.com">motherfuckingwebsite</a>. I also
      didn't have cellular data plan until college, so I knew the struggle of
      not have crazy fast wifi to load all the non-functional gimmicks of fancy
      websites.
