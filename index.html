    <h2>Why only html?</h2>
    <p>
      It is simple, fast, and dare I say, beautiful. It loosely represents my
      approach towards design and engineering as well as my developing visual
      design sense. My corner of the internet, like myself, is permanently in a rapid prototyping stage. 
      <br />
      Credit where credit is due, this website is inspired by
      <a href="//eladgil.com">eladgil.com</a> and
      <a href="//motherfuckingwebsite.com">motherfuckingwebsite</a>. I also
      didn't have cellular data plan until college, so I knew the struggle of
      not have crazy fast wifi to load all the non-functional gimmicks of fancy
      websites.
