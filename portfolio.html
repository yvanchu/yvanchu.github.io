    <h2>BearRoom</h2>
    <p>
      A Kahoot-style interface for digital board games for when you are with
      friends but without your favorite games
      <br />
      If you actually want to play these games, click on the link with your
      iPad/laptop/TV and create a room. You'll then get a QR code that each
      player can scan to join the room on their phone.

    <h2>Wing</h2>
    <p>
      Ever just wanted an excuse to leave that awkward date/party? With Wing, we
      can give you the perfect excuse to get out by getting a phantom call from
      your mom whenever you scratch your head. (This is a joke, I turned off
      Twilio integration after demoing at Wildhacks 2022, but you can still play
      around with the head scratch detection.)

    <h2>Tangible Glove Interface</h2>
    <p>
      A bi-directional glove interface that helps blind and low vision users
      navigate without audio distractions
    </p>
    <h2>Augmented Reality Monitor</h2>
    <p>
      What if your new computer monitor is the size of a poker chip? An mobile
      AR computer monitor concept to bring AR one step closer to adoption
      <br />
      As I've come to learn, developing mobile AR is a lot harder than I
      thought. This demo is as far as I got before deciding to stop and work on
      an idea that's a bit closer to my technical skill in 2020.
