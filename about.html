    <h2>Hafa adai!</h2>
    <p>
      I spent the first 9 years of my life in Taiwan, then 9 more in Guam. I am
      currently a Computer Science student at Northwestern as a QuestBridge
      Scholar.
      <br />
      In high school, I met my greatest mentor, who was also my robotics club
      advisor. Her guidance and lab gave me a direction and space for me to
      follow my ambitions: I leveraged these resources to assemble teams of
      students to compete in a range of STEM competitions, from drone design to
      underwater robotics. The long conversations regarding the future of
      science and technology with her combined with the success of my team in
      many competitions have taught me two things: the limitless potential in
      engineering and the synergistic powers of leadership, strategy, and effort
      in execution.
      <br />
      With even more resources at my disposal in college, I am ready to explore
      the world in technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship.
    </p>
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Maybe it's because I've spent 9 years living in tropical paradise, but I
        really enjoy walking and hiking in nature.
      </li>
      <li>I also play a lot of board games, especially strategic ones.</li>
      <li>
        I like to build things. I know that sounds vague, but I enjoy tinkering
        with laser cutters, 3d printers, Arduino, web dev, and most other
        engineer-y things. I don't really draw or make art though.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p>
      I have had experiences in the medical technology field across Taiwan and
      in the US, specifically at companies including ezClinic and WhaleTeq.
      Through these experiences, I have been able to grow my skills in software
      development and marketing, which correlates directly with my passion and
      interest in using technology to improve quality of life.
