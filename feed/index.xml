<h1 id="gratitude">Gratitude</h1>



<p>I’ve been feeling a bit unmotivated this past week, although I’ve just had one of the most productive week two weeks ago too.</p>



<p>Recently, I’ve been pretty inspired by Netero from Hunter X Hunter, especially on how his power isn’t derived from pure ambition to better himself, but rather from his gratitude towards martial art. I have heard that gratitude journaling can make you happier, but I never really considered how powerful gratitude is as an motivator. Yes, I want to work out, build BearRoom, and start a successful career because I want money, respect, and ability to make things, and yes, these motivations offer me big bursts of energy, but it’s thinking about my gratitude towards my s/o, my family, and everyone who’s helped me gotten this far that keeps me going. I want to give back and pay it forward, so others can enjoy the same opportunities I’ve had. This is what keeps me going consistently when my bursts of inspirations run out.</p>



<h1 id="life-goals">Life Goals</h1>



<p>Along that line, I’ve also decided to revisit what I wanted to do with my life, from the longest horizon to the present, to help me get a better sense of what I am doing and why I am doing these things&#8230;</p>



<h2 id="life">Life</h2>



<p>I remember that I’ve always said that I wanted to build technology to improve the quality of lives for people, and to take it one step further (if I don’t end up finding that special something to make), I want to invest in people that build technology to improve the quality of lives for people.</p>



<h3 id="why">Why</h3>



<p>If you ask me what life should look like 30 years from now, I believe in a world where people don’t have to starve, worry about shelter, and can work for the sake of fulfillment. Idealistic futurists have said that since the beginning of time, and I think we’re making decent progress towards that future. It may be naive for me to think that we’ll ever reach this state of the world, but it’s far more fun to believe and work towards building that future together.</p>



<h2 id="20s">20s</h2>



<p>I want to make enough money to not worry about money for the rest of my life. To do so, I need to either work at or create a successful startup. At this moment, I plan to work a few years in tech and acquaint myself with like minded people first.</p>



<p>Another strong contender for this is to maximize learning during my 20s since it’s when my brain will peak. Maybe I can go into management/stragey consulting? Product managmenet? I think I will revisit this option come spring quarter.</p>



<h3 id="why">Why</h3>



<p>It’s not like I ever struggled with money for food/clothing/shelter, but I would much rather be wealthy enough to not have to dedicate any time/effort to ever thinking about these issues. I also want the ability to explore new experiences around the world, and money certainly makes attaining new experiences easier.</p>



<h2 id="graduate">Graduate</h2>



<p>I wanna see the world! What for exactly? I am not sure! I certainly want to try a wide range of food, checkout scenic places, and (maybe) explore how innovation and learning looks like across culture.</p>



<h3 id="why">Why</h3>



<p>WHY NOT? I think just going to see new places and meeting new people will really stimulate my perspective on things and help me solidify my identity and future goals. I also want to just spend some quality time with my S/O before our careers officially start.</p>



<h2 id="2022">2022</h2>



<p>I want to decide on a career track and land a good job.</p>



<h3 id="why">Why</h3>



<p>It’ll determine my trajectory for my early 20s, and I can plan on how to leverage this job most effectively to accomplish my later goals</p>



<h2 id="winter">Winter</h2>



<p>I want to get good at writing research style paper and web development and push BearRoom to its very limit.</p>



<h3 id="why">Why</h3>



<p>I have the perfect courseload (DTR, Agile Development, Data Engineering, Intro to Web Dev) for it. There’s no better time to reflect on how I work and build BearRoom.</p>

<h2>The Yvan Advantage&#8230;</h2>



<p>After a lonely pandemic quarter living with my maternal grandfather in Taiwan, I finally started my internship in Taipei and began accepting the possibility of living in Taiwan for a while. I needed to go from surviving remote courses at awkward times to leveraging my unique situation as an unfair advantage. </p>



<h2>佳馨, 小菜, and the Corner Co-living Family</h2>



<p>First major decision I made coming to Taipei was renting in a co-living space rather than a studio apartment. I lived at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/c1Za2Qu2N1VYf3Sq6">Corner Co-living</a>, which was right next to Taipei Main Station. I&#8217;ve first seen the concept of co-living when Joel told me about the Digital Nomad lifestyle, where people do remote work while hopping between countries every few months. I thought this would be the perfect opportunity for me to hang out with a wider range of people, use the fully furnished kitchen, and experience new things. </p>



<p>Two months into living at Corner, I&#8217;ve been blessed enough to meet some really great people.</p>



<p>My roommate, Jiaxin, often challenges my thinking and makes me focus on introspective questions regarding my life goals and decision making process. My internal values and thought process has become clearer throughout this past two months.</p>



<p>My housemate, and potentially new roommate, we&#8217;ll call him Tsai for now. He&#8217;s a hardworking, hands-on, and thoughtful leader, he shows me his mastery in community building through event planning. He provides extreme value to Corner Co-living experience, and is the primary reason I will likely stay in Corner for next quarter. He also cooks and coordinates birthday and farewell parties. Amazing man.</p>



<p>Lulu, the house mascot dog!!! She&#8217;s amazing. It&#8217;s like having a pet but only keeping the best parts, no weird smell, absolutely adorable, petting and hugging friendly, and no need for maintenance on my end.</p>



<p>Corner co-living is also a great place to work. Michael, our landlord, plays some lofi hip hop or jazz in the living room, and it&#8217;s such a chill vibe for working or contemplation. My room is also very minimal and great for deep thoughts as well. The living room is optimal for relaxation, chatting, or low-stress high-productivity work, while my room is great for resting or introspective thinking.</p>



<h2>Nathan, David, and the WhaleTeq Team</h2>



<p>Three month internships can get a little dry, but I am working on more UX/learnability topics through redesigning new product interfaces and making tutorial videos, which is really interesting.</p>



<p>Nathan teaches me many entrepreneurial and formal leadership strategies. I really appreciate having a boss like him who I can join breakfast with and talk about tech, market trends, and strategy.</p>



<p>David is my supervisor. He really takes care of me and the rest of the company. He always finds ways to support everyone else, whereas I would just force my way in for the sake of efficiency. He builds a relatively more comfortable path for people and product to grow, whereas I would most likely create discomfort through sheer bluntness and speed.</p>



<p>The WhaleTeq team has really built my confidence up in speaking up and reaching out. Not only did my Chinese get more fluent these past two months, I feel a lot more confident in the workplace and my professional life as well. The people are all super nice, and I am getting better at expressing my ideas as well. Also, the flexibility of the team allows me to seek out new tools to optimize my workflow.</p>



<h2>Northwestern and its related resources</h2>



<p>With better introspective clarity and confidence in communication, I&#8217;m more prone to seeking mentorship and networking opportunities through Northwestern now. I am very thankful for the abundant resources available at Northwestern that synergizes with my more aggressive approach towards life planning and advice seeking.</p>



<p>This summarizes my distinct advantages throughout this summer. Hoping to grow even more next month around.</p>
