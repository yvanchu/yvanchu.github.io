    <h2>Work</h2>
    <p>
      Maximizing deep and fulfilling work. Technology will automate the mundane
      and empower people to reach and stay in flow.
      <br />
      That is why I joined Microsoft. I know work can be incredibly meaningful
      and fulfilling, but it often is not. I will build technology to help
      eliminate boring, stressful, and confusing work.
    </p>
    <h2>Life</h2>
    <p>
      I am actually not sure how living in the future will be or what coherent
      theme it will entail. I am most hopeful in tech that will help save time
      and increase safety. For example, self-driving cars.
    </p>
    <h2>Play</h2>
    <p>
      The current digital ecosystem is polluted with junk content. Like junk
      food, junk content are entertaining but not fulfilling. It is addicting
      and mostly driven by engagement and profit. I want to develop experiences
      that are playful, interactive, and fun. These experiences will help people
      strengthen existing and develop new relationships.
      <br />
      That is the reason I created BearRoom, but I still have ways to go in
      order to accomplish my vision in any of these three areas.
